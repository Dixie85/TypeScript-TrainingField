                      Now this is where the magic happens. How would you call this puppy? 
                      And can you guess it's breed? If you don't know now is the time to 
                      do a research and then edit the current dummy data. Use your imagination 
                      and try to guess the birth date of the puppy and write it done in the form.

                      No doubt is not just an ordinary form. You can either give the puppy of your

                      the EDIT button, or add a brand new puppy by clicking on the ADD button. 
                      Wouldn't that be fun?
